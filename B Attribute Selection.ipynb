    "* What if instead we had messages involving combinations of 64 words\n",
    "    * Could capture each word using a 6 bit number\n",
    "    * Thus a message with 10 words would cost 10 × 6 = 60 bits\n",
    "* However, if we knew more about the distribution of words, we could (on average) use fewer bits per message!\n",
    "    * e.g., \"the\" occurs more than any other word\n",
    "    * Use encodings whose lengths are inversely proportional to their frequencies (probabilities)\n",
    "* Entropy gives a precise lower bound for expected number of bits needed to encode a message (based on a probability distribution)\n",

    "* What the formula is saying:\n",
    "    * Since $0 < p_i \\leq 1$, we know that $-p_i log_2(p_i) \\geq 0$ is positive\n",
    "    * e.g., for $log_2(0.5) = y$, we have $2^y = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means $y = -1$\n",
    "    * If $p_i = 1$, then $-p_i log_2(p_i) = 0$\n",
